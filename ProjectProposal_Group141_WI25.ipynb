    "The prevalence of depression among college students has become a significant global concern, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. College students, who are navigating a transitional period characterized by heightened academic pressures, social changes, and increased independence, are particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges. Research indicates that depression among college students is not only widespread but also multifaceted, with influencing factors ranging from socioeconomic background to lifestyle and academic stressors. For instance, a study of 1,455 American college students revealed that 53% reported experiencing depression since starting college, while 9% indicated they had contemplated suicide during the same period (Furr et al., 2021). <a name=\"ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite-2) Furthermore, during the pandemic, over a quarter of Swiss university students exhibited depressive symptoms, a rate significantly higher than that of the general population and their pre-pandemic levels (Volken et al., 2021). <a name=\"ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Past studies have approached this problem from various angles, identifying key predictors and interventions (Liu et al., 2022). <a name=\"ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite-1) conducted a literature review examining the non-pathological factors contributing to depression among college students, categorizing them into biological, psychological, academic, and lifestyle influences. They emphasized the role of socioeconomic status, family support, and healthy living habits in mitigating depression. Their work also highlighted the potential of big data and machine learning for predicting depression, noting advancements in analyzing behavioral data from fitness trackers, smartphones, and social networks. Moreover, studies have explored specific cohorts within the student population, such as art students and those in Institutes of Technology (IT), who report higher levels of depression due to unique stressors and socioeconomic factors (McLafferty, Margaret et al, 2022). <a name=\"ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite-4) These findings suggest the importance of tailored mental health strategies addressing diverse needs within college communities.\n",

We hoped to compare these input features and make an association to the variable we are trying to predict, the student's depression level, which will also be collected from the students. Ideally, the dataset should be large enough, with approximately 10,000 or more subjects from around the world, that are considered 'enrolled' into a higher education facility at the time the survey took place. In an ideal situation, we would like to have Finally, in order to make the most informed and relevant analysis, it would be best if we could obtain data from the past 5 years since COVID 19 to assess the  state of happiness in college students in a post pandemic world. \n",

    "Privacy and ethics are important in researching students’ mental states especially since we are examining students' private lives, such as their sleep, study hours, and diet, to answer the question. Additionally, since our role in this project is researchers, not therapists, having unprofessional discussions with the participants about their mental states may bring about negative reactions, like PTSD. In these cases, we hoped to find existing datasets done by professionals. Otherwise, if we were to survey from scratch, we would like to ask specific questions that are neither too personal nor too triggering, with considerations arising from concerns. In terms of datasets, it is possible for there to be human biases, especially since we are asking participants to self-diagnose or give a score to their happiness or depression. To resolve this in an existing dataset, we can be extra careful in our analysis and look at borderline results more carefully. However, if we were to collect data from scratch, we could give a comprehensive answer choice for each ranking to prevent human biases, giving examples of what each score means so that participants don't randomly guess their score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, bias may appear in our data if it is taken from only one school or students of a specific background, not representating of all higher education students. Using a diverse dataset will give us the most effective and accurate data. To avoid these issues, our group will do our best to find a dataset that is not directly collected from one group and has similar commonalities such as school, race, religion, or gender. If we are unable to find a dataset with a variety of students, we will generalize whatever we find in our analysis to that specific population from which our dataset was obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since privacy, bias, and ethics are very important in our research, we will do our best to detect and resolve them throughout the project. We understand that it is important to communicate to the participants how their information will be used, protected, and stored; therefore first and foremost, we will get informed consent from our participants during the data collection period and allow them to opt-out whenever they want. During data collection, we will also try to watch out for bias by following our guide to avoiding human bias in the dataset above. While doing our analysis and using the participants's data, we will take utmost care of the data security and privacy of our participants. To ensure that the participants can trust us to keep their data and not opt out, we will remove identifying information about the subjects that are not needed, like their names, and store all the data safely. Furthermore, in our analysis, we will avoid creating multiple models to ensure not one algorithm is prone to bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in our conclusion/communication stage, we will consider bias and ethics by showing proof from our analysis. If our datasets are not representative of our original population, we will only generalize our analysis to the scope of the people who were represented in the dataset. It is also important to consider the difference between correlation and causation, which will allow us to avoid the cognitive bias mistake of trying to turn our correlation into causation.\n",
